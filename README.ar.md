# Week 2  Project

## Guidelines

The projects are meant to give you an idea of how well you understand, or can figure out, the material that you covered recently.
There's nothing to worry about, just try to do your best and enjoy the work.

- Fork this repo and clone down your fork to your laptop.
- Commit **working** code early and often (it is the best way that you can save your work).
- Leave comments that describe your work.
- Read the tasks carefully, and do them one by one. 
- After you are finished, submit a pull request following the steps that you have learned (guidelines for how to submit a pull request are in [Pull Request[Lecture Notes]](https://learn.makeen.ps/courses/take/introduction-to-javascript/multimedia/12105625-day-3-pull-requests-lecture-notes)).
